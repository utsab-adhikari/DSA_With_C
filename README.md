# DSA with C Repository

Welcome to my **DSA with C Repository**! This repository is dedicated to my **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) journey using C**.

## About

This repo is a record of my DSA learning journey throughout the semester. I will upload **all DSA programs, exercises, and practice problems** implemented in C here.

It is designed to:

* Track my progress in learning DSA
* Serve as a reference for solving common problems
* Provide clear examples of DSA concepts in C

## Contents

* Arrays, Strings, and Linked Lists
* Stacks and Queues
* Trees and Graphs
* Sorting and Searching algorithms
* Recursion and Dynamic Programming
* Problem-solving practice from beginner to advanced

## How to Use

You can:

* Explore my implementations for learning purposes
* Run the C programs locally
* Use them as reference for your own DSA practice

## Future Updates

I will continuously update this repository with:

* New DSA problems and solutions
* Optimized and clean implementations
* Notes and explanations of tricky problems
